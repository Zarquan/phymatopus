    Data Products Definition Document (DPD)
    http://ls.st/dpdd

        This document describes the data products and processing services
        to be delivered by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).

        4.5.1 Information Contained in Each Alert

            For each detected DIASource, LSST will emit an “Event Alert” within 60
            seconds of the end of visit (defined as the end of image readout from the
            LSST Camera). These alerts will be issued in VOEvent format 53 , and should
            be readable by VOEvent-compliant clients.

            ....
            ....

            The items above are meant to represent the information transmitted with
            each alert; the content of the alert packet itself will be formatted to confirm
            to VOEvent (or other relevant) standard. Where the existing standard is
            inadequate for LSST needs, LSST will propose extensions and work with the
            community to reach a common solution.

            We plan to use VOEvent as the format for alert transmission    

            The packet will be transmijed to VOEvent Brokers    

            We expect the community to provide sophis1cated brokers with classifica1on    
            engines, cross-­‐match capabili1es to other catalogs, etc.    

            LSST will provide a default, limited, broker    
            (to be discussed later)

            It has been understood for a number of years (da1ng back to pre-­‐PDR) that    
            it is outside the scope of the LSST Project to develop and provide advanced
            event brokering facilies.
            
            For example, brokers employing machine learning classifiers to filter the
            most interes1ng events in the event stream.
            
            Nevertheless,  the Project does have a mandate to provide a basic filtering facility

        Page 25

            To directly serve the end-­‐users, LSST will provide a basic, limited capacity,    
            alert filtering service. This service will run at the LSST U.S. Archive Center.    
            It will let astronomers create simple filters that limit what alerts are    
            ul1mately forwarded to them.
            These user defined filters will be possible to specify using an SQL-­‐like declara1ve
            language, or short snippets of (likely Python) code.


    Data Products Definition Review - Response
    (page 8 raises concerns abaout VOEvent format)

            While the XML based VOEvent format is currently a standard way of packaging 
            alerts for public distribution, it is very inefficient with respect to
            storage capacity and  network bandwidth. If a suitable, more compact format
            standard emerges, we recommend considering it.

    RFC-163 - Notes from meeting - What goes in a VOEvent
    https://community.lsst.org/t/notes-from-rfc-163-what-goes-in-a-voevent/667

        Executive summary:
        The original intent was to capture any thoughts on what should go in a
        VOEvent that is sent out to the public. This was predicated on the
        assumption that all subscribers would see identical VOEvents. Since
        we expect to send ~10 million alerts per night, it is important to
        optimize the contents.

        The conversation ended up being focused instead on the architecture
        of the event generation pipelines. @mjuric pointed out that the alert
        is not the VOEvent packet. Instead, we should think of the alert as
        the DIASource and all ancillary data. In this view, the filtering
        mechanism provided by LSST could be able to both cull alerts and format
        the resultant VOEvent. If this is the case, users will naturally only
        send on the minimum amount of data to get their science done. The
        question then becomes what else we can provide the filter to be useful
        (opposite of the previous question what can we avoid sending).

        @gpdf pointed out that allowing all alerts to be packaged independently
        in many different ways makes it very difficult to find all VOEvents
        derived from a given alert. It seems like this concern could be
        alleviated by producing a "master VOEvent" at the beginning of the
        pipeline for each alert which would be signed by LSST and referenced
        by any child VOEvent.


        Actions:
        There were three major actions taken from the discussion.
        Action 1: It would be very useful to make the full Object record
        associated with a DIASource available to the filtering mechanism.
        The current baseline is to just provide an ObjectId. This has a cost
        implication and requires a change to the DPDD. @connolly and @ivezic
        are asked to draft a proposal to send the the CCB. This will need
        input from @ktl.

        Action 2: @KSK and @connolly will take the sketch of the architecture
        presented by @mjuric and incorporate a fleshed out version in LDM-151.

        Action 3: @KSK and @connolly need to plan how to determine the optimal
        way of associating Objects with DIASources.
