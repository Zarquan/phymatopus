    Random notes on things we have found concerning (VO)Events in LSST.

VOEvent

    Discussion about 'What goes in a VOEvent'
    https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/RFC-163

    ****
    Notes from RFC-163: What goes in a VOEvent
    https://community.lsst.org/t/notes-from-rfc-163-what-goes-in-a-voevent/667


        Executive summary:
        The original intent was to capture any thoughts on what should go in a
        VOEvent that is sent out to the public. This was predicated on the
        assumption that all subscribers would see identical VOEvents. Since
        we expect to send ~10 million alerts per night, it is important to
        optimize the contents.

        The conversation ended up being focused instead on the architecture
        of the event generation pipelines. @mjuric pointed out that the alert
        is not the VOEvent packet. Instead, we should think of the alert as
        the DIASource and all ancillary data. In this view, the filtering
        mechanism provided by LSST could be able to both cull alerts and format
        the resultant VOEvent. If this is the case, users will naturally only
        send on the minimum amount of data to get their science done. The
        question then becomes what else we can provide the filter to be useful
        (opposite of the previous question what can we avoid sending).

        @gpdf pointed out that allowing all alerts to be packaged independently
        in many different ways makes it very difficult to find all VOEvents
        derived from a given alert. It seems like this concern could be
        alleviated by producing a "master VOEvent" at the beginning of the
        pipeline for each alert which would be signed by LSST and referenced
        by any child VOEvent.



        Actions:
        There were three major actions taken from the discussion.
        Action 1: It would be very useful to make the full Object record
        associated with a DIASource available to the filtering mechanism.
        The current baseline is to just provide an ObjectId. This has a cost
        implication and requires a change to the DPDD. @connolly and @ivezic
        are asked to draft a proposal to send the the CCB. This will need
        input from @ktl.

        Action 2: @KSK and @connolly will take the sketch of the architecture
        presented by @mjuric and incorporate a fleshed out version in LDM-151.

        Action 3: @KSK and @connolly need to plan how to determine the optimal
        way of associating Objects with DIASources.
